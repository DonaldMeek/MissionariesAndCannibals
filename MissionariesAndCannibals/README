The MissionariesAndCannibals application solves the Missionaries and Cannibals problem using iterative deepening. 

The Problem
There are three missionaries on the eastern island, three cannibals on the western
island, and one boat that can carry one or two people across. We must get every 
person and boat across to the opposite island without cannibals outnumbering missionaries
on either island. 

The Approach
This problem is solved using iterative deepening, where each case is represented by a node on a tree and each
node has a vector that stores the number of out-of-place missionaries, cannibals, and
boats. Movements of the boat and the people are represented by subtracting values at one new depth from
the root, adding values at the next depth, and continuing to alternate between adding and subtracting
values with each new depth until the solution of <0, 0, 0> is found. 

The Display
The MissionariesAndCannibals application prints the steps that it took to get to the solution. The application displays a 
vector for each node in the tree. The leftmost number is the number of missionaries on the incorrect side, the middle 
number is the number of cannibals on the incorrect side, and the rightmost number is the number of boats on the 
incorrect side.
